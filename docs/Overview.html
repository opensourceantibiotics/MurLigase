Many of the most effective antibiotics target fundamental pathways such as, bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, DNA replication and protein biosynthesis.

Mur ligase are a set of four Mur ubiquitin ligase enzymes: MurC, MurD, MurE, MurF which catalyze the addition of a short polypeptide to UDP-D-acetylmuramic acid in the process of bacterial cell wall buildup from peptidoglycans. <br>
All four enzymes are topologically similar. 

* MurC ligase or UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine ligase adds L-alanine to peptidoglycans.
* MurD ligase or UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligase catalyzes the conversion of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine (UMA), D-glutamate and ATP to UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine-D-glutamate and ADP. I.e. adds D-glutamate to peptidoglycans. 
* MurE ligase or UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alaninyl-D-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate ligase adds meso-diaminpimelate to peptidoglycans.
* MurF ligase or UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine-D-glutamyl-lysine-D-alanyl-D-alanine ligase adds D-alanyl-D-alanine to peptidoglycans.

Novel Pyrazolopyrimidine based inhibitors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MurC  have been reported [CHEMBL3355659](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL3355659) derived from a high-throughput screening hit [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/cb500360c).

Radio-labeled precursor incorporation showed these compounds selectively inhibited peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and genetic studies confirmed the target of pyrazolopyrimidines to be MurC. CHEMBL3355659 was a potent enzyme inhibitor IC50 0.001 uM, but showed poor against wild-type bacteria. However it showed appreciable antibacterial activity against efflux-deficient mutants.

A series of phosphorylated hydroxyethylamines have been evaluated for inhibitory activity against Mur ligases. The most potent inhibitor [CHEMBL473552](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL473552)had an IC50 of 6 μM on MurE.

A virtual screening campaign combining three-dimensional structure-based pharmacophores and molecular docking calculations [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.03.141) identified benzene 1,3-dicarboxylic acid derivatives shown to possess dual MurD and MurE inhibitory activity, [CHEMBL562422](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL562422) and [CHEMBL564223](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL564223).

This work has been continued [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2014.05.058) to improve activity against all Escherichia coli MurC–MurF enzymes to afford [CHEMBL3310464](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL3310464). Steady-state kinetics studies suggested this class to act as competitive inhibitors of the MurD enzyme towards d-Glu.

Dual Inhibitors of MurD and MurE Ligases have been reported [DOI](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fml300047h) with activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (IC50 values between 6.4 and 180 μM). An example being [CHEMBL2151317](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/compound/inspect/CHEMBL2151317).
