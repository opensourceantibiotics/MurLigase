# MurLigase
This repository contains everything to do with the Mur Ligase Project, which is an open source drug discovery project. The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, specifically inhibitors of the Mur ligase enzymes.  

To learn more about the background to the project and where we're up to, click on the Wiki tab above https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/murligase/wiki . To learn about the current needs of the project and how to get involved, click on the Issues tab, also above.

As an open source project you can be involved as a full participant. For a brief outline of what this means, take a look at [this "about" page over at Open Source Malaria](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/About-StartHere-FAQ).
